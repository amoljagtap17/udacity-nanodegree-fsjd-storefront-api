## Database Schema

The following tables are created in the _postgres_ database

- users

  ```
  | Column Name | Data Type             |
  | ----------- | --------------------- |
  | id          | integer (PRIMARY KEY) |
  | firstname   | varchar               |
  | lastname    | varchar               |
  | username    | varchar               |
  | password    | varchar               |
  ```

  | order_id    | integer (FOREIGN KEY to orders table)   |
  | product_id  | integer (FOREIGN KEY to products table) |
  ```

## Database setup

For connecting to the database please follow the following steps:

1. Connect to the default postgres database as the server's root user

```
> psql -U postgres
```

2. In psql run the following to create a user (Replace user name and password as needed)

```
> CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'adminpass';
```

3. In psql run the following to create the dev and test database

```
> CREATE database storefront_dev;
> CREATE database storefront_test;
```

4. Connect to the databases and grant all privileges (replace the user `admin` if different)

- Grant for dev database

```
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE storefront_dev TO admin;
```

- Grant for test database

```
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE storefront_test TO admin;
```

- Change owner of dev database

```
> ALTER DATABASE storefront_dev OWNER TO admin;
```

- Change owner of test database

```
> ALTER DATABASE storefront_test OWNER TO admin;
```

5. Rename the `.env_sample.txt` file to `.env`
6. Update the values for the different environment variables in this `.env` file as follows:

- POSTGRES_HOST=127.0.0.1 (host if postgres is running locally else update)
- POSTGRES_PORT=5432
- POSTGRES_DB=storefront_dev
- POSTGRES_TEST_DB=storefront_test
- POSTGRES_USER=admin (or the one created above)
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD=adminpass (or the one set above)
- ENV=dev
- BCRYPT_PASSWORD=secretpass (change to alphanumeric value)
- SALT_ROUNDS=10
- TOKEN_SECRET=tokensecret (change to alphanumeric value)

7. Install the `db-migrate` npm package globally using the following command (append `sudo` for mac systems)

```
> npm install -g db-migrate
```

8. Run the `up` migrations from the project folder using the following command

```
> db-migrate up
```

## Project setup

To get this project up and running one will need to:

Download the project zip file, unzip it & install the dependencies using the following command

```
npm install
```

To run the application on PORT 3000

```
npm run watch
```

Use `postman` tool to make the API request as listed above.

For the API endpoints where token is needed, pass the generated token by selecting type `Bearer Token` in `Authorization` tab in _postman_.

Token can generated by creating a new user or login an existing user.

## Unit Testing

To run the tests, run the following command in terminal (NOTE: Please stop the server if running on PORT 3000 before running the tests!)

```
npm run test
```

After the tests are executed the test database `storefront_test` will be deleted. To re-run the test, please create the database again.

# Storefront Backend Project

## Getting Started

This repo contains a basic Node and Express app to get you started in constructing an API. To get started, clone this repo and run `yarn` in your terminal at the project root.

## Required Technologies

Your application must make use of the following libraries:

- Postgres for the database
- Node/Express for the application logic
- dotenv from npm for managing environment variables
- db-migrate from npm for migrations
- jsonwebtoken from npm for working with JWTs
- jasmine from npm for testing

## Steps to Completion

### 1. Plan to Meet Requirements

In this repo there is a `REQUIREMENTS.md` document which outlines what this API needs to supply for the frontend, as well as the agreed upon data shapes to be passed between front and backend. This is much like a document you might come across in real life when building or extending an API.

Your first task is to read the requirements and update the document with the following:

- Determine the RESTful route for each endpoint listed. Add the RESTful route and HTTP verb to the document so that the frontend developer can begin to build their fetch requests.  
  **Example**: A SHOW route: 'blogs/:id' [GET]

- Design the Postgres database tables based off the data shape requirements. Add to the requirements document the database tables and columns being sure to mark foreign keys.  
  **Example**: You can format this however you like but these types of information should be provided
  Table: Books (id:varchar, title:varchar, author:varchar, published_year:varchar, publisher_id:string[foreign key to publishers table], pages:number)

**NOTE** It is important to remember that there might not be a one to one ratio between data shapes and database tables. Data shapes only outline the structure of objects being passed between frontend and API, the database may need multiple tables to store a single shape.

### 2. DB Creation and Migrations

Now that you have the structure of the databse outlined, it is time to create the database and migrations. Add the npm packages dotenv and db-migrate that we used in the course and setup your Postgres database. If you get stuck, you can always revisit the database lesson for a reminder.

You must also ensure that any sensitive information is hashed with bcrypt. If any passwords are found in plain text in your application it will not pass.

### 3. Models

Create the models for each database table. The methods in each model should map to the endpoints in `REQUIREMENTS.md`. Remember that these models should all have test suites and mocks.

### 4. Express Handlers

Set up the Express handlers to route incoming requests to the correct model method. Make sure that the endpoints you create match up with the enpoints listed in `REQUIREMENTS.md`. Endpoints must have tests and be CORS enabled.

### 5. JWTs

Add JWT functionality as shown in the course. Make sure that JWTs are required for the routes listed in `REQUIUREMENTS.md`.

### 6. QA and `README.md`

Before submitting, make sure that your project is complete with a `README.md`. Your `README.md` must include instructions for setting up and running your project including how you setup, run, and connect to your database.

Before submitting your project, spin it up and test each endpoint. If each one responds with data that matches the data shapes from the `REQUIREMENTS.md`, it is ready for submission!
